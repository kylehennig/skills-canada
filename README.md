# 2017 Skills Canada National Competition
Created by Kyle Hennig.

## Web Design and Development
This project was created during the Skills Canada competition hosted in Winnipeg on June 1-2, 2017. I was tasked with redesigning the 15-year-old website of the Winnipeg Railway Museum. I built the entire website in 12 hours with no Internet connection, competing against the top candidates from each of Canada's provinces and territories. My competitors and I were judged by a panel of industry professionals following two days of hard work on our websites and getting to know one another.
<br><br>
This project thoroughly tested my memory of different programming languages and my ability to quickly write code that met all the specified requirements.
<br><br>
My website placed second overall. I was awarded the silver medallion by Skills Canada.

## Getting Started
Install XAMPP, available at https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html. Open the XAMPP control panel, then start the Apache and MySQL modules.

Clone this repository using git to your htdocs folder (ie. `C:\xampp\htdocs`).


An SQL database named "museum" should be created in order to achieve full functionality. Running the SQL commands in `museum.sql` should be enough to populate the database with stock data (you can import this file using http://localhost/phpmyadmin/).

Open http://localhost/ in your web browser of choice to view the website in action.

## Built With
XAMPP v7.1.2<br>
PHP v7.1.2<br>
MariaDB v10.1.21<br>
jQuery v3.2.0<br>
